                        <h3>Santa Cruz, Boac, Marinduque</h3>
                        <p>In 1857, the cornerstone was laid for a wooden
                          church to replace the mission church. It served the parish until 1898, when it was torn down. In 1862, the Daughters 
                          of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul opened Holy Cross School, a day school as well as a boarding school, the first 
                          educational institution in the parish. In 1889, the construction of the present brick gothic church, under Rev. Hugh
                           McNamee, marks the end of the transition from Mission Santa Cruz to Holy Cross Parish. On September 25, 1891; the 
                           citizens of Santa Cruz erected a granite archway in front of the church to commemorate the founding of Mission Santa
                            Cruz. New buildings graced the parish from the 1920s through the 1960s, including the high school and rectory. From 
                            1982 to 1984, the interior of the church was renovated in preparation for the 1989 centennial. In 1989 the church was 
                            formally consecrated. During the ten years after the earthquake, the church was repaired and retrofitted, along with
                             the convent and the Mission Chapel. A new parish hall and gym were completed in 1999, and a Historic Garden was begun 
                             over the old Mission burial grounds in tribute to our Native American brothers and sisters.  </p>

                               steep climb is worth the effort. At the top of the hill is the cathedral’s compound which includes the church itself. </p>

                              <p>Records show that it was built sometime in 1609.
                                The church itself is magnificent. The church interior was wonderful. The ceiling had intricate fan carvings while the 
                                altar had coves which housed different saints. Beneath the church were the catacombs but we no longer explored it. 
                                What are so astonishing with this church are the decorations on the beams of the church.  Thousands of polished 
                                coconut shells were made into tiles and carefully placed on the every beams of the church.  Beneath the church were 
                                the catacombs but it was off limits at that time. To get to it, from the National Highway, climbing up to a steep road, 
                                then a series of stairs is necessary. Once reached the top, the view was rewarding. Glimpse of the Gasan beaches and 
                                the Tres Reyes Islands while a cool breeze relieved us of the heat from climbing up the steep staircase. </p>
